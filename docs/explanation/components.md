# Components
A component is any element that is attached to a system.

All components are required to define a name as a string (it is required in the base class). This
may not be appropriate for all classes. The `Location` class in this package is one example. In
cases like that developers can define their own name field and set its default value to `""`.

Refer to the [Components API](#components-api) for more information.
