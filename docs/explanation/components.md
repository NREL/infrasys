# Components
A component is any element that is attached to a system. There are two types of components:

- Component: anything attached to a system. These are typically used with non-physical objects,
such as [location](#location).
- ComponentWithQuantities: an element that contains attributes that are being modeled, often
representing physical devices and sometimes containing time series data. Examples are generators
or buses in a power system.

Refer to the [Components API](#components-api) for more information.
